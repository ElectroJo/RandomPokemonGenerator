# RandomPokemonGenerator
This is a very early stage random pokemon generator that I built for my friends and myself to do multi-battles with.
So far it can generate a set of pokemon for any ammount of users, and send them to pksm.
To build as a stand alone exe you need python 3.4.3, py2exe, and requests.
Use at your own risk, I'm bad at programming.
